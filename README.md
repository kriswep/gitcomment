# gitcomment

comments for your blog with a github issues backend.

Very early stages, very much a  WIP.

Idea is to create a reusable wrapper for integrating github issues to your blog as comments.

Will be implmented following the [function-as-child](https://medium.com/merrickchristensen/function-as-child-components-5f3920a9ace9) pattern.
